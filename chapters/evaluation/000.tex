\chapter{Evaluation}\label{chap:evaluation}
Evaluating the \bslongs{} derived from \dbased{} clustering and classification accuracy of \krap{} is key to gauging the effectiveness of these two techniques.
For the \dbased{} clustering method, we focused on cluster purity and clustering coverage.
For \krap{}, we investigate precision and recall and use an indicator that balances both of them called the \fmeasure{}.
