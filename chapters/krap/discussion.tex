\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion:krap}
As a \mst{} method, \krap{} performs well and offers many options for \cp{} researchers to improve classification accuracy.
Compared to the \dbscan{}-based \mst{} technique in \autoref{chap:clustering}, the accuracy of \krap{} performs slightly worse, but can classify the \spec{} of every \isol{} in \cplop{}, unlike the \dbscan{}-based method, which marks nearly half of \cplop{} as noise.
Furthermore, researchers have an automatic and transparent method of \spec{} classification, which can help them make more reasonable assertions when performing \mst{}.
Future work may be able to merge these two techniques together to improve classification speed and possibly improve \mst{} accuracy.
Such a ``\k{}-Nearest Clusters'' classification methodology might make range queries somewhat faster, but it is unclear how it might affect the classification accuracy.
