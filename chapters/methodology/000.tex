\chapter{\MSTlong{} Methodology}\label{chap:methodology}
There are two main components we investigated for the purpose of \mst{}: 
clustering for \bslongs{}
and
the \kraplong{} (\krap{}).
The clustering method we use is based off of the density-based clustering algorithm \dbscan, as introduced in \autoref{sec:dbscan} and described in \cite{johnson2015density}.
The \krap{} derives its classification ability from \kNNlong{}, outlined in \autoref{sec:knn}, adding four methods to resolve the multiple \knnlong{} lists that are a product of multiple neighbor-\compfuncs{} and an \a{} threshold to filter the \knnlong{} lists.
This Chapter describes the use of these two methods as classification methodologies for \cplop{}.
