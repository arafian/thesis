\chapter{Results}\label{chap:results}
Clustering for \bslong{} and investigating the \krap{} led us to focus on a volley of metrics in order to understand the nature of the data.
For clustering, we were interested in both the nature of the clusters --- the size, purity, and unique \spec{} within each --- as well as the clustering coverage --- how many \cplop{} \isols{} made it into a cluster, given a specific \minneigh{} value.
For \krap{}, we adjusted the values of \k{} and \a{} for each resolution strategy to gauge how effective each were at classification.
